# WTF is Jamstack?

Jamstack is revolutionising the way we think about workflow by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost and greater scalability.

This simple guide will help you understand why it exists and how to get started.

## About

This project was put together by [@peduarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte) and presented at the [Jamstack meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Jamstack-London/events/257961818/) ([decks here](https://speakerdeck.com/peduarte/jamstack-cheatsheet)) in London.

The goal of this guide is to gather the concept of Jamstack in a straight-forward guide to encourage other developers to adopt the workflow.
